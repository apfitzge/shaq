//! Multi-producer / multi-consumer broadcast queue in shared memory.
//!
//! Each producer owns its own ring (a `ProducerLane`); every consumer reads
//! every lane, so each published item reaches all consumers. Backpressure is
//! lossless — a producer cannot overwrite a cell until every consumer has read
//! it.
//!
//! [`Broadcast`] is the entry point: [`Broadcast::create`]/[`Broadcast::join`]
//! set up or attach to the queue itself, without claiming a producer or
//! consumer lane. Call [`Broadcast::producer`]/[`Broadcast::consumer`] as many
//! times as needed (once per lane/index wanted) to mint the handles below; a
//! single [`Broadcast`] can outlive and mint lanes for many threads.
//! [`Producer::create`]/[`Producer::join`], [`Consumer::create`]/
//! [`Consumer::join`], and [`SliceConsumer::join`] are convenience entry points
//! for processes that only need one endpoint.
//!
//! To embed a queue in a larger file, query [`BroadcastConfig::layout`], size
//! the enclosing file, and use [`Broadcast::create_at`]/[`Broadcast::join_at`]
//! or [`Broadcast::join_untyped_at`]. These APIs preserve the file size and
//! bytes outside the queue layout; the original `create` API still resizes the
//! file. Queue offsets need only satisfy the queried alignment, not OS page
//! alignment. The enclosing file is mapped in full and must remain its original
//! size for the lifetime of every handle or guard.
//!
//! [`Producer`] writes via by-value [`Producer::try_write`], an in-place
//! [`WriteGuard`], or a [`WriteBatch`]; [`Consumer`] reads via
//! [`Consumer::try_read`], a [`ReadGuard`], or a [`ReadBatch`], with blocking
//! `*_timeout` variants that park on the queue's futex when idle. A consumer
//! joins at each lane's reservation frontier, skipping values that were already
//! reserved. After a crash, a consumer index can be taken over with
//! [`Broadcast::recover_consumer`] or returned to the pool with
//! [`Broadcast::force_release`]. A fully joined consumer
//! resumes where the dead owner was; an interrupted join restarts at each
//! lane's current reservation frontier.
//!
//! [`Producer::try_prepare_write`] and [`Producer::try_prepare_write_batch`]
//! check capacity before caller work but leave both frontiers unchanged. Their
//! guards cancel on drop and publish only on explicit commit, including an
//! initialized-prefix option for batches. A consumer joining before commit can
//! receive these writes; a consumer joining at the advanced reservation frontier
//! skips them, as with legacy writes. Initialization precedes Release publication.
//!
//! Prepared guards expose lane-local sequence identity. Use
//! [`Producer::reclaimable_before`] (also available on prepared guards) to find
//! the published prefix no current or future correctly joined consumer can read.
//! This performs a synchronized consumer scan on demand, independently of ring
//! exhaustion. Sequence identities and reclamation bounds belong to one lane
//! in one queue instance, not to a global cross-lane sequence space.
//!
//! Counter wrap remains unsupported, as with legacy reservations.
//! Legacy single-cell reservations require caller initialization before drop or
//! any later write, even if their guard is forgotten. Forgetting a prepared guard leaves
//! both frontiers unchanged and permits subsequent writes.
//!
//! Producer lanes bind to at most one producer for the queue's lifetime: a lane
//! is claimed on join and permanently retired when its producer drops; a
//! crashed producer's lane stays claimed. Neither returns to the free pool, so
//! per-lane state always describes a single producer. Replacing producers
//! means recreating the queue.
//!
//! Each lane carries metadata: a caller-supplied [`ProducerId`] and a counter
//! of items rejected by backpressure. The producer ID is permanently associated
//! with its lane, including after the producer is dropped. Shaq treats IDs as
//! opaque values and does not enforce uniqueness; callers requiring distinct
//! producer attribution must provide unique IDs on producer creation.
//!
//! A read guard exposes the publishing lane's metadata via
//! [`ReadGuard::lane_metadata`]. To poll metadata by lane index, borrow
//! [`LaneMetadata`] with [`Broadcast::lane_metadata`].
//!
//! Typed payloads require `T: Copy`, which ensures that `T` cannot implement
//! [`Drop`] and therefore does not require a destructor when a cell is
//! duplicated or reused. File-backed typed construction remains unsafe because
//! the queue cannot verify that every participant uses the same `T` and layout,
//! or that embedded pointers and references are valid in every process that
//! reads them.
//!
//! Recovery is an externally serialized operation. Do not race recovery or
//! force-release with other recovery operations, with joins/drops for the same
//! queue, or with a still-live owner of the index being recovered.
//!
//! The region is a fixed header (magic/version, the global consumer-ownership
//! table, and the blocked-consumer wake counter) followed by one lane block per
//! producer.
