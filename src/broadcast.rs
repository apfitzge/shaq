//! Multi-producer / multi-consumer broadcast queue in shared memory.
//!
//! Each producer owns its own ring (a `ProducerLane`); every consumer reads
//! every lane, so each published item reaches all consumers. Backpressure is
//! lossless — a producer cannot overwrite a cell until every consumer has read
//! it.
//!
//! [`Broadcast`] is the entry point: [`Broadcast::create`]/[`Broadcast::join`]
//! set up or attach to the queue itself, without claiming a producer or
//! consumer lane. Call [`Broadcast::producer`]/[`Broadcast::consumer`] as many
//! times as needed (once per lane/index wanted) to mint the handles below; a
//! single [`Broadcast`] can outlive and mint lanes for many threads.
//! [`Producer::create`]/[`Producer::join`], [`Consumer::create`]/
//! [`Consumer::join`], and [`SliceConsumer::join`] are convenience entry points
//! for processes that only need one endpoint.
//!
//! [`Producer`] writes via by-value [`Producer::try_write`], an in-place
//! [`WriteGuard`], or a [`WriteBatch`]; [`Consumer`] reads via
//! [`Consumer::try_read`], a [`ReadGuard`], or a [`ReadBatch`], with blocking
//! `*_timeout` variants that park on the queue's futex when idle. A consumer
//! joins at each lane's publication frontier, skipping values already published.
//! Writes in progress are received if they publish after the join. After a
//! crash, a consumer index can be taken over with
//! [`Broadcast::recover_consumer`] or returned to the pool with
//! [`Broadcast::force_release`]. A fully joined consumer
//! resumes where the dead owner was; an interrupted join restarts at each
//! lane's current publication frontier.
//!
//! Dropping a producer releases its lane for reuse. A replacement continues
//! from the lane's publication frontier, preserving unread values and consumer
//! progress. A crashed producer's lane stays claimed; replacing it requires
//! recreating the queue. Unpublished writes leave the publication cursor
//! unchanged, allowing a replacement to reuse their cells.
//!
//! Each lane carries metadata: its lane index and a counter of items rejected
//! by backpressure over the lane's lifetime.
//!
//! A read guard exposes the publishing lane's metadata via
//! [`ReadGuard::lane_metadata`]. To poll metadata by lane index, borrow
//! [`LaneMetadata`] with [`Broadcast::lane_metadata`].
//!
//! Typed payloads require `T: Copy`, which ensures that `T` cannot implement
//! [`Drop`] and therefore does not require a destructor when a cell is
//! duplicated or reused. File-backed typed construction remains unsafe because
//! the queue cannot verify that every participant uses the same `T` and layout,
//! or that embedded pointers and references are valid in every process that
//! reads them.
//!
//! Recovery is an externally serialized operation. Do not race recovery or
//! force-release with other recovery operations, with joins/drops for the same
//! queue, or with a still-live owner of the index being recovered.
//!
//! The region is a fixed header (magic/version, the global consumer-ownership
//! table, and the blocked-consumer wake counter) followed by one lane block per
//! producer.
