//! Multi-producer / multi-consumer broadcast queue in shared memory.
//!
//! Each producer owns its own ring (a `ProducerLane`); every consumer reads
//! every lane, so each published item reaches all consumers. Backpressure is
//! lossless — a producer cannot overwrite a cell until every consumer has read
//! it.
//!
//! [`Producer`] writes via by-value [`Producer::try_write`], an in-place
//! [`WriteGuard`], or a [`WriteBatch`]; [`Consumer`] reads via
//! [`Consumer::try_read`], a [`ReadGuard`], or a [`ReadBatch`], with blocking
//! `*_timeout` variants that park on the queue's futex when idle. A consumer
//! joins at the current frontier, or with the `*_from_backlog` variants up to one
//! ring behind it to also read data published before it joined. After a crash, a
//! lane or consumer index can be taken over with `recover` (resuming where the
//! dead owner was) or returned to the pool with `force_release`.
//!
//! Payloads are treated as shared-memory bytes, not as ordinary Rust-owned
//! values. In practice `T` should be POD-like: no process-local pointers, no
//! references whose provenance matters in another process, no destructor that
//! must run, and safe to duplicate by raw reads. This is stricter than a normal
//! queue because every broadcast consumer can read the same cell.
//!
//! Recovery is an externally serialized operation. Do not race recovery or
//! force-release with other recovery operations, with joins/drops for the same
//! queue, or with a still-live owner of the index/lane being recovered.
//!
//! The region is a fixed header (magic/version, the global consumer-ownership
//! table, and the blocked-consumer wake counter) followed by one lane block per
//! producer.
