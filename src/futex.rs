//! Futex-backed waiting for the shared-memory queues.
//!
//! The futex word is a 64-bit atomic whose low 32 bits change on (or just
//! before) every wake. For the single-cursor queues it is the publication
//! cursor itself — every publish advances it. A multi-cursor queue (the
//! broadcast, which has one cursor per lane) instead points waiters at a
//! dedicated wake counter that a publish bumps only when a waiter is present
//! (see [`Waiters::bump_and_wake`]); there the caller's `check` is what gates
//! on real data, and the counter exists only to break a racing `FUTEX_WAIT`.
//!
//! # Why no wake is lost
//!
//! The producer advances the futex word (Release), then issues a SeqCst fence
//! and loads `waiters`, skipping the wake syscall if it is zero. A waiter
//! increments `waiters`, issues a SeqCst fence (in `register`), then rechecks
//! for data before sleeping. SeqCst fences are totally ordered, and a load
//! after the later fence must see a store made before the earlier one. So
//! either the producer's load sees the waiter and wakes it, or the waiter's
//! recheck sees the new data (or `FUTEX_WAIT` bounces with `EAGAIN`) and it
//! never sleeps. Without the fences both loads can be stale and a wake can be
//! lost.
//!
//! # The futex word
//!
//! Userspace accesses the word only as a 64-bit atomic; the kernel's 32-bit
//! `FUTEX_WAIT` compare reads its low half (byte offset 0 on little-endian, 4
//! on big-endian), which is 4-byte aligned and cannot tear. Never materialize
//! an `&AtomicU32` into it in Rust code — only a raw pointer passed to the
//! syscall. If the word advances by an exact multiple of 2^32 between snapshot
//! and compare the wait oversleeps; that is bounded by the timeout and
//! astronomically unlikely.
